This is a repo of JavaScript toy problems that I have created with built in tests.

To get started:

1) Clone repo to your computer
2) Open folder with VSCode and navigate to the toyproblems folder. This is where all the toy problems are.
3) Fill out the functions as instructed, then simply run the file to check your code.
4) Have fun!
