This is a repo of JavaScript toy problems I have created as well as written built in tests for.

To get started:

1) Clone repo to your computer
2) Open folder with VSCode and navigate to toyproblems > toyproblems.js. This is where all the toy problems are.
3) Don't forget to uncomment the built in tests, then simply run the file to check your code.
4) Have fun!
