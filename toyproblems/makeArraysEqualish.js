/* Make Arrays Equal(ish):

- Given 2 arrays of numbers and of different lengths, trade numbers between them to get the totals of the arrays to as close to equal as possible, without changing the length of the arrays.
- Sort the arrays before returning them within another array.

Example:

Input: [22, 5, 6, 56], [44, 33, 89]
Output: [[5, 22, 44, 56], [6, 33, 89]]
