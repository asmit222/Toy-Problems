/* Find The Next Number:

- Given a series of 3 numbers, the following function is meant to figure out the pattern in order to predict which number will come next.
- the pattern will always be a multiplication or addition of the same number over and over (it can be negative or positive, but it won't be 0).

Examples:

Input: [2, 4, 6]
Output: 8

Input: [3, -9, 27]
Output: -81
