/* Tic-Tac-Toe :

  - Write some code that takes in a board of an about-to-be won game of tic-tac-toe and determines where the final 'x' needs to be placed in order to secure the win.

  - The 3 board columns will be represented by '1', '2', and '3'
  - The 3 board rows will be represented by 'a', 'b', and 'c'
  - There will always be only 2 x's and 2 o's on the board

  Example:

  Input:
  [
  ['x', 'o', ' '],
  ['x', 'o', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', ' ']
  ]

 Output: '1c'
