/* Tic-Tac-Toe :

  - Complete the function that takes in a board of an about-to-be-won game of tic-tac-toe and determines where the final 'x' needs to be placed in order to secure the win.

  - The 3 board columns will be represented by '1', '2', and '3'
  - The 3 board rows will be represented by 'a', 'b', and 'c'
  - There will always be only 2 x's and 2 o's on the board

  Example:

  Input:
  [
  ['x', 'o', ' '],
  ['x', 'o', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', ' ']
  ]

 Output: '1c'

/* Next Number:

- Given a series of 3 numbers, the following function is meant to figure out the pattern in order to predict which number will come next.
- the pattern will always be a multiplication or addition of the same number over and over (it can be negative or positive, but it won't be 0).

Examples:

Input: [2, 4, 6]
Output: 8

Input: [3, -9, 27]
Output: -81
