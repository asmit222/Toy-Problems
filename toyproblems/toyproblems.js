/* Tic-Tac-Toe :

  - Complete the function that takes in a board of an about-to-be-won game of tic-tac-toe and determines where the final 'x' needs to be placed in order to secure the win.

  - The 3 board columns will be represented by '1', '2', and '3'
  - The 3 board rows will be represented by 'a', 'b', and 'c'
  - There will always be only 2 x's and 2 o's on the board

  Example:

  Input:
  [
  ['x', 'o', ' '],
  ['x', 'o', ' '],
  [' ', ' ', ' ']
  ]

 Output: '1c'

/* Next Number:

- Given a series of 3 numbers, the following function is meant to figure out the pattern in order to predict which number will come next.
- the pattern will always be a multiplication or addition of the same number over and over (it can be negative or positive, but it won't be 0).

Examples:

Input: [2, 4, 6]
Output: 8

Input: [3, -9, 27]
Output: -81

/* Make Arrays Equal(ish):

- Given 2 arrays of numbers and of different lengths, trade numbers between them to get the totals of the arrays to as close to equal as possible, without changing the length of the arrays.
- Sort the arrays before returning them within another array.

Example:

Input: [22, 5, 6, 56], [44, 33, 89]
Output: [[5, 22, 44, 56], [6, 33, 89]]
